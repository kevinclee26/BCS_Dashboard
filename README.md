# BCS_Dashboard: 
### This dashboard was built to help manage student progress on bootcampspot

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinclee26/BCS_Dashboard/master/image/demo.PNG)

The dashboard uses the bootcampspot API to retrieve most of the data. As such, there are two requirements needed: 
* static/config.js - to include your own credentials
* static/weeklyFeedback - to download prior feedback scores since the API only tracks the most recent

Specific Documentation on the BCS API can be found here:
